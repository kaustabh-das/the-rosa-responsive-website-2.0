# the rosa responsive website-2.0
 In this project i build a responsive website from start to finish using HTML 5, CSS 3, and a little bit of Vanilla JavaScript. We will also learn how to use keyframes and hover effect animations as well as a new tool to animate on scroll called Scroll Reveal. Finally we will use media queries to make this web design responsive!
